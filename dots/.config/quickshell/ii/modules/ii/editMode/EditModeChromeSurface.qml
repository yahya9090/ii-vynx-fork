/**
 * One screen's worth of Edit Mode's chrome: a full-screen layer surface that is
 * transparent everywhere except the toolbar on it.
 *
 * Why not on the background surface: the desktop stays where it is - the
 * wallpaper and the widget canvas are already there - but those surfaces are
 * on the Background and Bottom layers, under the bar and the dock, which stay
 * in place at full size. Chrome drawn there would sit under the bar. So the
 * chrome takes a surface of its own on Overlay, and the desktop does not move.
 *
 * Three things a surface this size has to get right:
 *
 * Input. A screen-sized surface that accepts input everywhere makes the
 * desktop underneath unclickable - and the desktop underneath is the thing
 * being edited. The mask is the toolbar and nothing else.
 *
 * Blur. rules.lua's catch-all blurs every `quickshell:*` surface with a low
 * alpha threshold, under which a screen of transparent pixels asks the
 * compositor to blur the whole screen. The namespace is minted AND listed there
 * at `ignore_alpha = 1`, so only the toolbar's opaque body is blurred.
 *
 * Keyboard. None, deliberately: Escape and the arrows are answered by the
 * WidgetCanvas on the widgets surface, and a chrome surface taking OnDemand
 * focus would sit in front of it and swallow the keys. The one exception is
 * the catalogue's search field, which cannot be typed into without it: the
 * surface takes OnDemand focus for exactly as long as that field holds it, and
 * the field's own Escape empties it and then lets go.

    // the previous value back through the same services. Entries pushed while
    // a replay runs are dropped by GlobalStates, so a replay's own write does
    // not record itself.
    //
    // The theme is the one asynchronous case: the switch script writes the
    // palette file and the mode flips when the shell reads it back, long after
    // the replay returned. The value a replay asked for is remembered, and the
    // change that answers it is not recorded.
