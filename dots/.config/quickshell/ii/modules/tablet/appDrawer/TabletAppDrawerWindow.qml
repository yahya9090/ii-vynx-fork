/**
 * The full-screen surface the app drawer is drawn on, one per monitor.
 *
 * The backdrop blurs a frozen screencopy rather than letting Hyprland blur the layer. A
 * layer rule can only switch blur on or off; its strength is the surface's own alpha, and
 * the shell's `ignore_alpha` rule turns even that into a threshold. So compositor blur
 * arrived as a step part-way through the animation instead of ramping with it. Blurring a
 * snapshot here is the only way the strength can follow the finger, and it is the same
 * thing TabletShadeWindow does for the same reason.
 *
 * With `appearance.transparency` off there is no capture and no blur at all: the drawer
 * sits on a solid surface colour, which is what that setting means everywhere else.
