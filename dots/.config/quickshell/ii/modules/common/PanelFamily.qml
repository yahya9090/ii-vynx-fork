 * Which panel family is running, and what that family pins.

 * `Config.options.panelFamily` is a persisted string. Reading it directly spreads
 * `=== "tablet"` comparisons through the bar, the settings pages and the gesture
 * service, and every one of those is a place a new family has to be remembered.
 * Ask this singleton instead.
 *
 * The distinction that matters to shared code is almost never "is this the tablet"
 * but "is this family touch-first" or "does this family pin the bar" — those are
 * the questions with a stable meaning when a fourth family appears. Prefer the
 * capability properties over `isTablet`.

     * The list lived in shell.qml, as an array the cycle shortcut walked, and nowhere else —
     * so nothing could offer the user a choice, and the only way between families was to
     * cycle through the ones in between, rebuilding each on the way. This singleton already
     * answers "which family runs"; "which families exist" belongs beside it.
     *
     * Keep in step with `Config.enumConstraints["panelFamily"]`, which is what rejects a
     * hand-edited value.
     *
     * The strings are plain English, translated by whatever draws them — the same shape
     * TouchGestureActionRegistry uses. Translation lives in qs.services, and qs.services
     * imports qs.modules.common, so a policy singleton in common cannot reach for it
     * without closing that loop.
