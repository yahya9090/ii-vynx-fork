/**
 * Compiling one of the shell's Rust helpers from inside the shell.
 *
 * Both helpers — the on-screen keyboard's `osk_autoshow` and the touch gesture
 * daemon's `touch_gestures` — ship as source and are correctly kept out of git. On a
 * fresh install neither runs, and until this existed the only way out either offered
 * was a command to paste into a terminal.
 *
 * That is an acceptable answer on a desktop and a circular one on a tablet: the two
 * things standing between a device with no keyboard and a usable shell are the
 * keyboard that raises itself and the gestures that navigate, and the fix for both
 * required a keyboard to type it. So the build is a button, and this is the button's
 * machinery, shared because there are two of them and they differ only in a path.
 *
 * Not a singleton: one instance per helper.
